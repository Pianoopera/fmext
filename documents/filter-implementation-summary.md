# Filter Feature Implementation Summary

## Story 1.4: Filter Implementation âœ…

The filter feature has been successfully implemented with the following capabilities:

### 1. New `--filter <KEY> <VALUE>` syntax
- Can be used multiple times for AND conditions
- All filters must match for a file to be included
- Works seamlessly with other options (--count, --key, etc.)

### 2. Backward compatibility maintained
- Legacy syntax `--key <KEY> --value <VALUE>` still works
- Cannot be combined with new --filter syntax

### 3. Implementation details:
- Filters are applied **before** any other processing
- Supports all value types:
  - String values: exact match
  - Array values: contains check
  - Boolean/Number values: string conversion
- Verbose mode shows filtering statistics

### 4. Updated files:
1. **mod.ts**:
   - Added filter parsing in `parseArgs()`
   - Implemented pre-filtering logic before main processing
   - Added verbose output for filter statistics

2. **README.md**:
   - Added documentation for new --filter syntax
   - Added Example 6 showing advanced filtering
   - Updated CLI options table
   - Expanded filtering behavior section

3. **Test files**:
   - Created `tests/filter/` directory with test fixtures
   - Added unit tests for parseArgs filter handling
   - Added integration tests for filter matching logic

### 5. Usage examples:

```bash
# Single filter
fmext --filter published true articles/*.md

# Multiple filters (AND condition)
fmext --filter published true --filter type tech articles/*.md

# Filter with counting
fmext --filter status draft --count --key topics articles/*.md

# Filter with key extraction
fmext --filter type tech --key title articles/*.md

# Filter with verbose mode
fmext --filter published false --verbose articles/*.md
```

### 6. Key design decisions:
- Filters use AND logic (all must match)
- Filtering happens early to improve performance
- Clear error messages for invalid filter syntax
- Maintains compatibility with existing functionality

The implementation follows the user story requirements and provides a flexible, powerful filtering system for the fmext CLI tool.
